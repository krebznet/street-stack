Overview:
We create 1 minute buckets for each entity. the document will have a timestamp so we know what minute it is, it will
also have an entity so we know what entity it is. then it has an array of snapshots for each second within the minute
and each second has the list of variables and their values. 

Implementation:
Every 1 minute we would sort snapshot messages into groups based on the value of "entity" in the snapshot message. 
At the end of every 1 minute we would create a bucket document for each entity and would construct a document structure
similar to Strategy1.json

If we don't have 60 snapshot messages for a specific entity this would be logged as an error. The snapshot producer should
always send 1 snapshot per 1 second for each entity.
